Hello and welcome to the LeanerCloud ONCE bundle!

# About the bundle

This is a bundle of AWS cost optimization tools and Terraform building blocks useful for companies currently running AWS at scale and interested in reducing their cloud computing costs.

It was created by [Cristian Magherusan-Stanciu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristimagherusan/) of [leanercloud.com](https://leanercloud.com), who built these tools(and many more) for his own use at helping many companies optimize AWS costs by thusands and thousands of dollars, and thought they may also be useful to other people doing such work.

The bundle will grow over time as Cristian will release more of his more than a dozen of optimization tools.

# Content of the bundle

The bundle currently includes the following tools:
- Optimizer, LeanerCloud's flagship AWS cost optimization tool that does rightsizing with conversion to Graviton for RDS, OpenSearch and ElastiCache resources, typically for 20-50% cost savings without any long term commitment.
- Lambda cost estimator, a tool that calculates how much it would cost you to replace your entire capacity with Lambda and CloudFront, based on your load balancer request metrics.
- A bunch of Terraform building blocks that allow wou to build serverless infrastructure using Fargate, Lambda+CloudFront and Aurora Serverless v2, which can accelerate a lot the implementation work if you want to act on the results of the Lambda cost estimator tool mentioned above. 

# License terms

This code is released under the 37signals [ONCE](https://once.com) model, so you pay a single one-off fee to get access to the full source code of the entire bundle.

You can then use these as much as you want(at scale they can help you save your company millions) and adjust them for your own use.

You just can't distribute the code to others or build derived products based on it, so this is source available, not open source.

# Price

Currently the price is $999 one off, increasing each time we release new tools to the bundle, and we also offer generous rewards for testimonials, currently 80% money back as Amazon voucher.

# How to buy

You can pay it on [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/5kA7unbJ1g3UbN6146) or also pay for it on your AWS bill for a small $100 surcharge covering the AWS fees, just drop us an [email](mailto:cristi@leanercloud.com) to get further details about that.

# Support add-ons

We also have add-on packages that include company-wide licensing, enterprise support and even feature development for a flat monthly fee based on your needs. Again, drop us an [email](mailto:cristi@leanercloud.com) to get further details about it.
